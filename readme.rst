============================
Auto Sort Tabs for Sublime Text 4
============================

This plugin sorts the tabs in Sublime Text 4 by file name. It is based on the
Sort Tabs plugin for Sublime Text 2. I removed menu options to sort and all
the other methods of sorting as I only want my tabs to be in alphabetical order.

The sorting happens automatically on file load, save, or view activation. I
think the original plugin had some fledgling time based optimization work
ongoing, and an automatic closing feature. I might look at those later.
